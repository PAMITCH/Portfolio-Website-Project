      <p>Hi I'm Quinn. I'm 23 years old. I make both traditional and digital art pieces. I've been making art for a total of 10 years and have a wide range of skill sets.  I mostly specialize in cartooning and character design.</p> 

      <p>I'm currently in the midst of kick-starting my first comic  on Webtoon that has yet to be announced. I also design my own merch, and the store is currently a work in progress.</p>

      <p>In the past I've been recruited to work on major animation projects for character design but unfortunately the projects would either be dropped or I wasn't able to be paid for my work.</p>

      <p>If you would like to inquire about projects for story boarding and character design feel free to email me by going to the “ Contact” page and clicking the ***email link***!</p>
